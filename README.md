This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.12.

## Development server

First, run npm i to install all necessary dependencies.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Testing

Run npx cypress open to open the Cypress test suite. Then, choose sample_spec.js to execute end2end-Test.

## Misc

Normally, all feature branches in git would be deleted. For ease of workflow tracking, I kept them for the time being.
